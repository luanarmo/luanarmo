# 🧑🏽About me:
## 👋 Hi, I'm Luis Angel Arroyo
### 🧑🏽‍💻 A computer systems engineer from Mexico.

📖 I'm currently learning Javascript Full-stack on my own and collaborating with other colleagues in the reengineering of the CIMPS congress website.

🦉 I love challenges that can push me to learn new things and improve my skills. In my free time, I like to solve logic problems like the ones that can be found on the HackerRank website.

🔍 I actively seek opportunities that will bring me more knowledge and skills. I am willing to commit 100% to any project that aligns with my career goals.

📒 My native language is Spanish, and I am currently perfecting my English level through language courses and practice.

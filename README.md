# 🧑🏽About me:
## 👋 Hi, I'm Luis Angel Arroyo
### 🧑🏽‍💻 A computer systems engineer from Mexico.

📖 I'm currently learning Javascript Full-stack on my own and collaborating with other colleagues in the reengineering of the CIMPS congress website.

🦉 I love challenges that can push me to learn new things and improve my skills. In my free time, I like to solve logic problems like the ones that can be found on the HackerRank website.
